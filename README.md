# Installer Package for macOS _R_ toolchain [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20%28%3E=%202%29-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)

The repository contains the scripts used to create an installer package (.pkg)
that contains binaries used to create the CRAN official macOS _R_ binary. 
Specifically, the installer will try to download and install:

- Xcode command line tools (XCode CLI) from Apple
- `clang4` from <http://r.research.att.com/libs/>
- `gfortran` from <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS-1>

For those interested, the installer can be obtained
on either the project's [**release page**](https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools/releases/latest)
or through <http://go.illinois.edu/r-macos-rtools-pkg>. The pre-built binaries this
installer encloses can be found at <https://developer.apple.com/download/more/>,
<http://r.research.att.com/libs/>, and <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS-1>. 
Unlike the [previous installer](https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-clang), 
which only installed `clang4`, this installer requires internet access
to work.

**Note** The installer package was developed by [James Joseph Balamuta](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com)
and has no connection with the R projectâ€™s macOS CRAN maintainers. 
Financial support was provided to sign the installer by 
[Professor Timothy Bates](http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/timothy-bates) 
of the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).

## How do I use the installer?

1. Download it from the project's [**release page**](https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools/releases/latest)
   or through <http://go.illinois.edu/r-macos-rtools-pkg>.
2. Open the installer by either double click or right clicking to bring up menu and selecting "Open".
3. From here, navigate through it like a normal macOS installer.

**That's it.**

Once installed, you can start using compiled code
in _R_ like normal with the added benefit of `OpenMP`.

If you want to see behind the curtain, continue reading...

## What does the installer do?

The macOS _R_ toolchain installer performs four actions that require
the user's password to accomplish. These actions are:

1. download and install XCode CLI via secure Apple product update
1. download, verify, and install the `clang4` pre-made binary 
   files into the `/usr/local/clang4` directory
1. download, verify, and install `gfortran`
1. establish the proper paths for `CC`, `CXX`, `CXX**`, `FLIBS`,
    and `LDFLAGS` in the  `~/.R/Makevars` file

Verify steps are conducted using embedded md5 hashes of the files.
If the hash is not identical to what was embedded, the installer will
exit. For details as to how this implemented please see
[Issue 8: Verify pkg hash](https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools/issues/8)
and the 
[Pull Request 10: Feature Pkg Hash Verification](https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools/pull/10).

In essence, it provides a graphical user interface installation guide,
more secure path manipulation, and a smarter handling of a pre-existing
`~/.R/Makevars` when compared to a pure bash approach.

## Verify the Installer

Thanks to the **financial support provided by [Professor Timothy Bates](http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/timothy-bates) of
the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/)** to join the [Apple Developer program](https://developer.apple.com/).
The installer is now signed using [developer credentials](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html).

As a result, the installer should have a "lock" icon in the upper right corner:

![Signed Installer Lock Icon](readme_img/lock_icon.png)

Clicking the lock icon will reveal the signed developer certificate:

With this being said, the code used to generate the installer has been made publically available under an open source license (GPL >= 2). 

## Overview of Files

Below is an abridged version of the actions of each file provided.

- `scripts/postinstall`
   - Downloads and Installs Xcode CLI, `clang4`, and `gfortran`
      - Detects the appropriate `Command Line Tools` dmg installer
	    by using a [headless cli check](https://github.com/timsutton/osx-vm-templates/blob/ce8df8a7468faa7c5312444ece1b977c1b2f77a4/scripts/xcode-cli-tools.sh#L8-L14),
		downloads the installer from <https://developer.apple.com/download/more/>,
		and installs it using `softwareupdate`.
      - Downloads the `clang-4.0.0-darwin15.6-Release.tar.gz` from
       <http://r.research.att.com/libs/> and extracts it into `/` directory 
	    so that it is installed on `/usr/local/clang4`
      - Detects the appropriate gfortran binary (either 6.1 or 6.3) from
        <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS-1>, 
		downloads it from <http://coudert.name/software/>, and
		installs it into `/usr/local/gfortran`
   - Create or modify the `~/.R/Makevars` file with the necessary implicit variables
     to compile.
	   - `CC`, `CXX`, `CXX**`, and `LDFLAGS` for `clang4`
	   - `FLIBS` if on macOS Sierra / High Sierra (10.12 - 10.13) to avoid
	     a headache.
   - This is run at the _end_ of the installer routine.
- `make_installer.sh`
   - Create the installer package R binary installer `.pkg`
      - Builds the package from the extracted tar using `pkgbuild` 
      - Analyzing the package using `productbuild` to create a `distribution.xml`   
	  - Inserts customizations into the `distribution.xml` (title, background, ...)
	  - Calls `productbuild` to rebuild the package.
- `distribution.xml`
   - Customization options (e.g. title, background) of installer built by analyzing a temporary .pkg
- `build_files/Rlogo.png`
   - R logo
- `build_files/LICENSE.rtf`
   - License of the Xcode CLI, LLVM installer, and gfortran
- `build_files/WELCOME_DISPLAY.rtf`
   - Text displayed on welcome screen
